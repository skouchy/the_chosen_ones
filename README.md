# RENDEZCREW
## DIRECTIONS FOR MEG!!
CLI: ```npm start```
Browser: localhost:3001/login
*then you'll see the 2 buttons (dinky as hayl) 'register a trip' or 'join a trip'*
click ```register trip``` -> it'll take you to the page.. but then nothing else happens cuz front end and backend are not talking... but I know backend works via insomnia
*then Browser again:* localhost:3001/new-user (just to peek at basic original bootcamp student)
*then Browser again again lol :* localhost:3001/ (just to see) the homepage of a trip... and essentially that original idea came with being able to filter crew mates.. like, if you're the one grocery shopping for the trip, you can filter search, for example, # of vegetarians, nut allergies/etc... or as trip leader - you can filter, who says they are bringing boats and/or which kind... obvi basic minimal details here... but, to be able to filter out the only info you're looking for.. def better as a search bar, but that was the whole idea, and the only idea, at that, that was built on the page for sake of presentation (which still fell flat lol)

also, I'm sure you're wondering about handlebars... using handlebars for front end was part of the acceptance criteria.. and quite dumb, and became the massive hold up once I had the backend working.. 


## Description
Planning river trips, no matter if it’s a single or multi-day trip, can take a lot of logistics. Despite any person’s love or hate for spreadsheets, collecting and viewing necessary data from invitees via a home grown spreadsheet for every. single. trip, can be its own logistical headache. 

Here is an app that allows Trip Leaders/Permit holders to consolidate their whole crew to one mobile hub that gathers all necessary data needed to plan a river trip.

## Usage
* Handlebars
* Express
* Javascript
* Sequelize
* Anime https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime/
* CSS
* mysql2
* bcrypt
* dotenv

## User Story
AS a Trip Leader(TL) for a river trip,
I WANT an app that consolidates trip logistics
SO THAT myself and all other's that I want to invite on the trip can input logistical and personal details necessary for all to view and revisit.
