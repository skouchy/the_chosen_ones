## Description
Planning river trips, no matter if it’s a single or multi-day trip, can take a lot of logistics. Despite any person’s love or hate for spreadsheets, collecting and viewing necessary data from invitees via a home grown spreadsheet for every. single. trip, can be its own logistical headache. 

Here is an app that allows Trip Leaders/Permit holders to consolidate their whole crew to one mobile hub that gathers all necessary data needed to plan a river trip.

## Usage

* Express
* Javascript
